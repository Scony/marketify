          <p>
	    if{y} is platform allowing phone to react for events automatically. Whole idea is based on Recipes - short code fragments defining actions.
	    For example it can respond for pre-defined SMS with some status data (localization, battery level, etc.), discard incoming calls (in given time, or
	    from given number) or even tell us when our friend is near us if we both have application running and GPS enabled.
	    All these examples and many others are archiwed by Recipes. They are responsible for one scenario and can be turned on and off. Every user can create
            their own recipe and share with others using Market. Recipes have access to many data and actions on phone. We divided it into Features. Every Recipe
            must declare, what features it uses, so you don't have to care if recipe disabling your wi-fi connection can read your SMS.
            To create your own Recipe some basic programming knowledge is requiered - they are java classes extending our base YRecipe class. If you don't have
            such knowledge don't worry - maybe you would be able to find Recipe you need on Market. Most of recipes have some parameters that you can use to
            tune them for your needs.
